<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HDPE Decking Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capped composite</li><li>Uncapped composite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HDPE decking comes in two main types on the market: capped composite and uncapped composite. Capped composite decking is covered with a protective layer to prevent moisture penetration and staining, making it more durable and resistant to wear and tear. On the other hand, uncapped composite decking does not have this protective layer, making it more susceptible to damage from the elements. Both types offer a low-maintenance alternative to traditional wood decking while still providing a high level of durability and longevity.</p></p>
