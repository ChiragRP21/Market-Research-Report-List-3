<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phalloidin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluorescent</li><li>Non-fluorescent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phalloidin is a type of toxin that binds specifically to actin filaments, making it useful for studying the organization and dynamics of the cytoskeleton in cells. In the fluorescent market, phalloidin is conjugated with a fluorescent dye, allowing for visualization of actin filaments under a microscope. This is particularly useful for fluorescence microscopy and live cell imaging. In the non-fluorescent market, phalloidin is used without a dye, typically for biochemical assays and structural studies of actin filaments. Both types of phalloidin have important applications in cell biology research.</p></p>
