<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Power Factor Correction Capacitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inflatable Type</li><li>Filled with Degradable Resin Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Power factor correction capacitors are used to improve the power factor of electrical systems, increasing efficiency and reducing energy costs. There are two main types of power factor correction capacitors: inflatable type and filled with degradable resin type. </p><p>Inflatable type capacitors have a flexible casing that expands during operation, allowing for more space for the capacitor plates to store electrical energy. Filled with degradable resin type capacitors use a resin that breaks down over time, releasing any hazardous materials in a controlled manner. Both types of capacitors help to maintain a stable power factor in electrical systems.</p></p>
