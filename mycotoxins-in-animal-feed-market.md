<p><strong>The Mycotoxins in Animal Feed Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ruminants</li><li>Swine</li><li>Poultry</li><li>Aquatic Animals</li><li>Other Livestock</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mycotoxins in animal feed are toxic substances produced by molds that can contaminate feed ingredients, posing a threat to animal health. In ruminants, mycotoxin exposure can lead to reduced feed intake and production efficiency. Swine are particularly susceptible to mycotoxins, which can cause digestive upset and reproductive issues. Poultry exposed to mycotoxins may experience decreased growth and egg production. Aquatic animals are also vulnerable to mycotoxin contamination, leading to poor growth and disease susceptibility. Other livestock species can be similarly impacted by mycotoxins, affecting overall health and productivity.</p></p>
