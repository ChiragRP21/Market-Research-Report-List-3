<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bituminous Waterproofing Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>APP (Atactic Polypropylene) Modified</li><li>SBS Modified</li><li>Self-Adhesive Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bituminous waterproofing membranes are commonly available in three types: APP modified, SBS modified, and self-adhesive membranes. APP modified membranes are made by blending atactic polypropylene with asphalt to create a durable and UV-resistant membrane. SBS modified membranes use styrene-butadiene-styrene to increase flexibility and elongation, making them ideal for areas with temperature fluctuations. Self-adhesive membranes have an adhesive backing for easy installation without the need for heating equipment. All three types offer excellent waterproofing properties and are commonly used in construction projects.</p></p>
