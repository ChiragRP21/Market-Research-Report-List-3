<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inorganic Base Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soluble</li><li>Insoluble</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inorganic bases can be classified into two main types based on their solubility in water. Soluble inorganic bases dissolve completely in water, forming a clear solution. These bases include compounds like sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. On the other hand, insoluble inorganic bases do not dissolve in water and instead form suspensions or precipitates when mixed with water. Examples of insoluble inorganic bases are metal oxides like magnesium oxide and calcium oxide. Both soluble and insoluble inorganic bases play important roles in various industrial processes and applications.</p></p>
