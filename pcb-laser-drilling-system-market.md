<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB Laser Drilling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CO2 Laser Drilling System</li><li>UV Laser Drilling System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PCB laser drilling systems are classified into two main types: CO2 laser drilling systems and UV laser drilling systems. CO2 laser drilling systems use a carbon dioxide laser source to ablate the material on PCBs, while UV laser drilling systems use an ultraviolet laser source for the same purpose. CO2 systems are typically used for drilling holes in thick materials, while UV systems are more suitable for drilling very precise and small holes in thin materials. Both types offer high precision and efficiency in PCB drilling processes.</p></p>
