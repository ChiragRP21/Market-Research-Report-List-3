<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Reflective Glass Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electron Beam Evaporation</li><li>Sputtering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-reflective glass coatings are primarily produced through two main methods: Electron Beam Evaporation and Sputtering. Electron Beam Evaporation involves heating a material in a vacuum, causing it to evaporate and then deposit onto the glass surface. Sputtering utilizes a plasma discharge to bombard a target material, causing it to be ejected onto the glass. Both methods result in thin, transparent coatings that reduce glare and improve visibility. These coatings are commonly used in eyeglasses, camera lenses, windows, and electronic displays.</p></p>
